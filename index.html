            <h3>Where it all started ... </h3>
                <p>It was a hot summer's evening and I was supposed
                    to be studying for an exam. I was in Grade 8 but
                    I remember it like it was yesterday. I was paging
                    through a Huisgenoot and came across a picture of
                    Brad Pitt sitting on a motorbike. Something tickled
                    in my brain and I grabbed a pencil and a piece of
                    paper.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Not even a blank paper, the one one with lines
                    across that I tore out the book I was supposed to be
                    making notes in. I started drawing and a coupled of
                    minutes later I stared at the paper, surprised that
                    I got more than a stick drawing out of it but a picture
                    that kind of resembled Brad Pitt. And as they say,
                    the rest is history.

                    <p>
                    I was scrolling through my phone photos from
                    that winter trip to the French Alps when I stopped
                    at this one shot of the sun setting behind
                    snow-covered peaks. Something about the way the
                    light hit the snow made me grab my camera. Three
                    years later I brough the picture to life during an
                    art class.

                        I was tired of cleaning up all the paint
                        on a daily basis and decided one day to try my
                        hand at digital art and fell in love with it!
